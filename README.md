# 7 Days 7 React Projects

# About

This is a self improvement challenge for myself to solidify my knowledge in React. Within the final week of April 2022, I will create 7 different react projects.

## Project 1: Infinite Scroll

This project is all about the implementation of the infinite scroll in React. The goal of this project is to successfully imitate Twitter's infinite scroll. With that said, this project is not a clone of any social media apps since this project only highlights the web-design technique.

## Project 2: Toggle Theme (Light/Dark Mode)

This project is about the implementation of light and dark mode feature in a React web app. My motivation for this project is to learn how this type of technique can be implemented in React.

## Project 3: Content Filtering

This project is about implementing a content filtering in a website. In this project, filtering is triggered when the user selects a specific genre from the drop down menu. The API returns an array of genre IDs for every movie returned. The data is then filtered to check if the movie contains a specific genre using the includes() method. Only the objects with the specified genre ID will be displayed. Lastly, I added animations when the filtering occurs using Framer Motion.
