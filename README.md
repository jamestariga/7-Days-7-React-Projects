# Blog App

## About

This is my 5th react project for this challenge. This is my first PWA project. The application itself is just a basic weather app where the user can search the current weather using the city name. Then I added a service worker which is a promise based function to cache in data in the browser. [Visit the site](https://pwa-weather-app-jamestariga.netlify.app/)

## Scope

- The project is built to create a progressive web application.
- The main functionality of the app is to search for a city to get the current weather.

## Running Locally

To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js and git installed in your computer to use npm and git commands.

```
git clone [this repo]
npm install --save styled-components
npm install axios
```
