# Movie Filter

## About

This is my third react project for this challenge. This project highlights content filtering in many applications. The goal of this project is to filter out movies or shows based on their genre. [Visit the site](https://movie-filter-jamestariga.netlify.app/)

## Scope

- The project is built to showcase the content filtering technique.
- This project uses the TMDB [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
- This project does not contain any real content such as the full movie/show, or trailer for that matter.

## Running Locally

To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js and git installed in your computer to use npm and git commands.

```
git clone [this repo]
npm i axios
npm i dotenv
npm i framer-motion
npm install --save styled-components
```

To successfully replicate the project, you will need to declare a '.env' file in the root folder where you will then declare your TMDB [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
