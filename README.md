# Framer Motion Modal Animation

## About

This is my final react project for this challenge. This project highlights modals or a page element that displays in front of and deactivates all other page content. I used Framer Motion to achieve the bouncing animation as well as when the modal exits the page. [Visit the site](https://modal-jamestariga.netlify.app/)

## Scope

- The project is built to showcase modal animation using Framer Motion.
- This project does not have any functionality other than displaying the modal upon clicking on the button.

## Running Locally

To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js and git installed in your computer to use npm and git commands.
