# 7 Days 7 React Projects

# About

This is a self improvement challenge for myself to solidify my knowledge in React. Within the final week of April 2022, I will create 7 different react projects.

## Project 1: Infinite Scroll

This project is all about the implementation of the infinite scroll in React. The goal of this project is to successfully imitate Twitter's infinite scroll. With that said, this project is not a clone of any social media apps since this project only highlights the web-design technique.
