# REACT INFINITE SCROLL

## About

This is my first react project for this challenge. This project highlights the infinite scroll technique that is widely used amongst many social media apps such as Twitter.

## Scope

- The project is built to showcase the Infinite Scroll technique.
- This project uses the open library [API](https://openlibrary.org/search.json).
- This project does not have an optimized search function.

## Running Locally

To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js and git installed in your computer to use npm and git commands.

```
git clone [this repo]
npm i axios url
npm i framer-motion
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
