# Blog App

## About

This is my 4th react project for this challenge. This project highlights state persistence using local storage in React. The goal of this project is to store the user input in the browser's local storage. [Visit the site](https://blog-app-jamestariga.netlify.app/)

## Scope

- The project is built to showcase how state persistence can be achieve by storing data in the local storage.
- This project can only add items or delete items from the local storage. By no means can it rearrange or edit current items in the list.
- There is no database for this project.

## Running Locally

To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js and git installed in your computer to use npm and git commands.

```
git clone [this repo]
npm install --save styled-components
npm install uuid
```
